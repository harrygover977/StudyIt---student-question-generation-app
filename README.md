# StudyIt - An app for students that converts notes into questions

## This app is a working progress built using Flask in Python.

This project is currently a working progress but the goal is to buils the number 1 student companion app. The idea is to allow users to upload their own notes or notes from text books and have AI generate questions to test their knowledge on the notes. This is a way of turning passive learning in reading/writing notes into a practical, recall based practice. 

### possible upcoming features 
* question generator 
* Flashcard generator
